/*
The query is designed to measure customer migration & retention across different segments over a one-year period. It identifies customers who were classified as Frequent Transactors and High Value, and determines what percentage of them migrated or remained in the High Value segment by the end of 2024.

Objectives: 
1. Measure customer retention and understand how well the company is maintaining its most valuable customers over time. 
2. Determine whether customers in a segment tend to stay there or downgrade to lower segments 
3. Identify churn risks for customers that don't remain in a high value segment.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of retention strategies, loyalty programs based on retention and migration. 

Aplications:
- Refine segmentation strategies by adding layers of data such as demographic, behavioral, financial, etc.
- Develop and improve loyalty programs to keep High value customers engaged and promote migration. 
- Introduce personalized offers to encourage higher engagement in customers that fell to lower tier.
- Predict the LTV and plan marketing budgets effectively
- Compare retention rates with industry benchmarks to assess the company's competitive position.
